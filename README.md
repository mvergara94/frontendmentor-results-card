## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned mainly how to use the "display: flex" property to organize elements in a flex container. Styling properties were also practiced. However, the most important aspect was breaking away from the routine of just seeing exercises in a class and facing challenges that required me to find ways to overcome them.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, mainly in Flex and Grid displays, which are essential to achieving functional layouts on the web today. And soon i will start to study Js to have tools that make easier some things.


### Useful resources


- [Guide to Flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot, because it's so visual. Anyone can understand display:flex with this guide.
